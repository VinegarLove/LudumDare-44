# Project made for the Ludum Dare 41
## This was made in 48 hours

Finally it’s here.

We had a lot of stuff to finish, but it’s still better than the last time.

It’s a little platform game in pixel art (partially unfinished gameplay, music was finished in time). It’s al little rough with one day off.

Anyway, enjoy the game and thanks again to @GnevCP for the awesome music and sfx.
Hope to be here again next year :D
